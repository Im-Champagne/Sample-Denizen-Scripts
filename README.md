# 🍾 Sample-Denizen-Scripts | Bringing Quality of Life to Minecraft!

Hello there! I'm Champagne, and I am **thrilled** you've stopped by my repository! ✨

This collection is a passion project to share simple, easy-to-implement **DenizenScript** solutions that are sure to bring quality-of-life (QoL) improvements to any vanilla-style Minecraft server. Denizen is so fun and easy to use, and I love using it to create features without needing lots of other **fricken** plugins!

These scripts are examples designed to make daily Minecraft life cleaner, simpler, and much more vivacious.

## 💖 Why Denizen QoL?

I believe that security is the foundation, but fun is the metric! Good development means making things easy, clean, and stable. Every script here aims to:

* **Be Simple:** Just a few lines of code for immediate, noticeable results.
* **Be Stable:** Designed to be clean and minimize the chance of borking.
* **Be Fun:** Add a touch of ✨sparkle✨ and joy to common tasks.

## 🛠️ How to Use These Scripts

Using these scripts is super simple! If you're new to Denizen, you should be checking out [`[Denizen Beginner's Guide]`](https://guide.denizenscript.com) to familiarize yourself with setting up scripts.

1.  **Prerequisites:** You must have **Denizen** installed on your Spigot/Paper server.
2.  **Installation:** Save the DenizenScript code to a `.dsc` file located in your server's `plugins/Denizen/scripts/` folder.
3.  **Reload:** Run the command `/ex reload` in-game or in the console.
4.  **Enjoy!** 🎉

> **Note:** If a script ever gets **borked**, needs a tweak, or requires updating, feel free to open an issue! We can all experience personal growth together!
